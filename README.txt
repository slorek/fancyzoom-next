= FancyZoom Next

A refactored version of jnunemaker's FancyZoom plugin, currently for jQuery only.

This version has been rewritten to more flexible; it interacts gracefully with the DOM, uses CSS rather than hard-coded styles, and doesn't use tables.

== Status
This project is *in development* and should not be considered stable. Full documentation and minified versions will follow.

Currently it has not been fully tested in all browsers/situations.

== Roadmap
Currently the animations work with CSS3 transitions. I intend to implement Modernizr support to enable fallback functionality for other web browsers.
